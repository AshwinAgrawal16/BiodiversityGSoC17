# GSoC-2017-Integrating biodiversity data curation functionality.
Test solution (R Package) for GSoC-2017 project proposal : Integrating biodiversity data curation functionality.

The Easy test case solution is in EASY folder.

The medium test case solution is the R package itself and the function is in folder named R.

The hard test case solution is in HARD folder.

The HARD folder also contains the further work I have done in the project to manage DwC data and clean it by developing appropriate functions. It also contains other important functions related to the project.
